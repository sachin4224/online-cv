    title: About Me
    summary: |
        Hey! there, I am senior undergraduate in the department of Computer Science And Engineering at
        IIT Kanpur, India. During the college years I have developed deep passion for Artificial 
        Intelligence, Cognitive Sciences, and Quantitative Finance. I'm interested, particulary, in 
        applying deep learning and AI to solve the challenging problems of our society. Also, I'm very
        curious about how AI will change the financial industry in upcoming years. My quest to solve 
        some of the problems led me to work in close collaboration with Prof. Sergey Axyonov where I
        worked on a project to help medical professionals diagnose Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and other 
        lung related dieses using SOTA AI techniques.

experiences:
    - role: Visiting Researcher
      time: May 2018 - Jul 2018
      company: Tomsk Polytechnic University, Tomsk, Russia
      details: |
        I was advised by Prof. Sergey Axyonov on my project which was focused on medical image 
        processing. The first task was to find pathological regions inside lungs related to Pneumonia, 
        and Tuberculosis using Computed Tomography(CT) scans. The second task  was to design a tool
        which could compare the CT images taken at different times so any potential reduction/increment
        in the pathological regions could be monitored.

          - For the first task, I used various image processing techniques like  filtering, thresholding, 
            segmentation to seperate the lung regions with other regions like tissues etc. I also 
            applied K-Means to segment the lung regions.
          - For the second task, I applied image registration techniques in SimpleITK library(United States 
            National Library of Medicine’s Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit). These registration
            techniques include Euler 3D Transformation, Affine Transformtion, and Displacement Field Transformation.
            The best results were obtained using Displacment Field Transformation. At the end, the tool was
            able to track the changes in the area of pathological regions inside lungs. 
            

    - role: Quantitative Research Consultant
      time: Sep 2016 - Aug 2019
      company: WoldQuant LLC, India
      details: |
            My work mainly consisted of making Statistical Arbitrage alphas(trading signals) 
            with 3-5 sharpe ratios and returns > 10% in Asian, European, and US stock markets.
            For that, I was constantly researching financial literature to find new alpha signals
            in the stock markets, and systematically converted the ideas into mathematical models
            and backtested the signals on historical dataset of previous 10 years to avoid overfiting 
            and data-mining.
            - Consistently performed well in the firm and was among Tier 1 consultants
            - Developed alphas generated a total profile of approximately $50k for the firm
            - Combined and worked with price-volume,  fundamental, analyst estimates and many 
              other datasets to build robust alphas and employed strategies like neutralization, 
              diversification, and data visualization to minimize risk
            - Worked closely with Senior Quantitative Researchers and other Research Consultant in 
              the firm to successfully complete Alpha Quality Projects 
            - Attended various Meet-Ups held at different locatins in India and worked in teams & with
              Senior staff of the firm to network and discuss alpha ideas


    - role: Algorithmic Trading Trainee
      time: Jan 2019 - Apr 2019
      company: Auquan, India
      details: |
            I was advised by Chandani Jain, Ex-Derivative trader at Optiver, during the training phase 
            which consisted of experimenting with mid-frequency data of minute scale to build algorithmic
            trading strategies in US stock markets. 
            The main highlights of the training programs are:
            
            - Learnt the basics of Financial Engineering and employed the same in real world data
            - Applied Machine Learning and Technical Analysis to build  trading strategies in Python
            - Improved the raw signals by introducing hedging, neutralization, and pair’s trading
            - Made signals based on moving averages, RSI, mean reversion, and momentum
            - Backtested the strategies against historical data to avoid overfiting/underfiting
            
            
    - role: Quantitative Summer Trainee
      time: May 2016 - July 2016
      company: WorldQuant LLC, India
      details: |
            - Learnt the basics of Quantitative Finance, and made 70 alphas in US stock market
            - Offered the position of Quant Research Consultant for excellent performance in summer
